## Understanding the 6502 Microprocessor
The 6502 microprocessor was a popular chip in the 1970s, used in many famous computers like the Apple I and Commodore 64. It features:
- 8-bit data bus
- 16-bit address bus
- Data sheet (30 pages)

## Step-by-Step Assembly Instructions

This section meticulously breaks down each phase of the assembly process into clear, manageable steps. Starting with organizing your components, you'll move on to setting up your breadboards, wiring the CPU and support chips, and then proceed to connecting memory and I/O devices.

### 1. Connect the 6502 Microprocessor to Power
