### Connecting 6502 to Memory and I/O

1. Address lines (A0-A15) connect to memory devices (like ROM and RAM) and I/O peripherals.
2. Data lines (D0-D7) connect bidirectionally to memory and I/O devices.
3. RWB signal connects to memory and I/O devices to indicate read or write operations.
4. Clock signal (PHI2) is provided externally to drive the processor's timing.

### Considerations

- The 6502 reads from addresses FFFC and FFFD on startup to determine the program start address (reset vector).
- Proper setup of interrupt vectors is crucial for handling IRQ and NMI.
- The RDY pin can be used to introduce wait states for slow memory or I/O devices.
- The BE (Bus Enable) pin allows external control of the processor's buses, useful in multi-processor systems.
- Careful timing considerations are needed, especially when interfacing with memory and I/O devices of varying speeds.

- Data Lines (I/O0-I/O7): Bidirectional pins for data input during write operations and data output during read operations.
- CE (Chip Enable): When low, it enables the chip. When high, it puts the device in low-power standby mode.
- OE (Output Enable): Controls the output buffers. When low, it enables data output during read operations.
- WE (Write Enable): Controls write operations. A low-to-high transition initiates a write cycle.
- VCC and GND: Power supply connections.

### Connecting EEPROM to 6502

1. The 6502 has 16 address lines (A0-A15), allowing access to 65,536 unique addresses.
2. Two options for connecting:
   - Connect A0-A14 directly, repeating ROM contents twice in address space.
   - Use A15 to control EEPROM's chip enable (CE), allowing the upper half of address space for other uses (RAM, I/O).

### Considerations

- The 6502 reads from addresses FFFC and FFFD on startup to determine where to begin fetching instructions.
- These addresses should be accessible in the ROM for proper initialization.
- Proper connection of CE, OE, and WE pins is crucial for correct operation and power management.


## Understanding the NAND Gate
The SN74LS00N is a quadruple 2-input positive-NAND gates chip. In our 6502 computer project, we're using it as an inverter. Here's why it's essential:

1. **Clock Signal Inversion**: The 6502 requires a specific clock signal timing. The NAND gate, used as an inverter, helps shape the clock signal to meet these requirements.

2. **Logic Level Conversion**: It can be used to convert between different logic levels if needed in our circuit.

3. **Signal Buffering**: The NAND gate can act as a buffer, helping to maintain signal integrity in our circuit.

4. **Noise Reduction**: By using the NAND gate as an inverter, we can help reduce noise in our clock signal, ensuring more reliable operation of the 6502.

5. **Flexibility**: The chip contains four NAND gates, giving us flexibility to use the remaining gates for other logic functions if needed in future expansions of our project.

| Pin | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **#1, #4, #9, #12** | **Input A** | Input A for each of the four NAND gates |
| **#2, #5, #10, #13** | **Input B** | Input B for each of the four NAND gates |
| **#3, #6, #8, #11** | **Output** | Output for each of the four NAND gates |
| **#7** | **GND** | Ground |
| **#14** | **VCC** | Positive supply voltage |

</details>

### Key Features
- Four independent 2-input NAND gates
- Low power Schottky TTL logic
- Operation from a single 5V supply
- Fully compatible with most TTL families

### Using NAND as an Inverter
1. Connect both inputs of the NAND gate together.
2. Use this as the single input for your inverter.
3. The NAND gate's output will now be the inverted signal of your input.

### Considerations
- Ensure proper power supply (5V) and grounding for reliable operation.
- Be mindful of propagation delays when using for time-sensitive operations.
- Use decoupling capacitors near the VCC pin to reduce noise.
- Unused inputs should be tied to a defined logic level (high or low) to prevent floating inputs.
